\section{EXPERIENCE}

 {\bf Makani Power}, \emph{Design Engineer Intern \hfill November 2012 - February 2013} \\
 Designed, implemented, and tested structural elements and chain drives. Rapid prototyping was coupled with hand analysis, CAD (with SolidWorks, NX) and FEA (with CosmosWorks). Worked with steel, plastic, and carbon-fiber composite. These efforts contributed to the rapid and successful completion of Makani's integrated ground station, a mobile system acting as an anchor, a winch, a perch, and a battery array for the Wing 7 airborne wind turbine. 

 {\bf Daedalus Innovation}, \emph{Backend Web Developer \hfill September - November 2012} \\
 Coded core web application functionality in Python/Django and integrated with external packages including Zinnia CMS and OpenTok. Managed a Postgresql database and a Heroku deployment. These efforts contributed to BookAndTalk.com, a soon-to-be-launched startup bringing together book groups and famous writers. 

 {\bf Fairfield Foundation}, 
 \emph{Archaeology Intern \hfill July - September 2012}\\
Archaeological fieldwork at four colonial sites in Tidewater Virginia. Surveyed, dug, cleaned, interpreted, and mapped test units and shovel tests. Sorted, cleaned, and catalogued artifacts. Did archival research on a historic estate. Helped renovate a 1920's gas station.

 {\bf 16.622: Senior capstone project} \hfill \emph{Fall 2010 - Spring 2011} \\
Designed and implemented a yearlong experiment, with a partner, under faculty guidance. Applied machine learning techniques to ultrawideband radio waveforms to improve localization performance. Tested ability to identify the material of barriers blocking the line of sight. 

 {\bf MIT Technology Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Structures } \\
 \emph{Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program \hfill Summer 2010}\\
Designed, machined, and tested a device to hold individual carbon fibers under tension inside a CVD furnace. The results obtained with this device made up an entire chapter of a PhD thesis. Grew aligned carbon nanotube forests. Prepared carbon fibers with various coatings and tested their tensile strength. Prepared and cured graphite-epoxy composites.

 {\bf MIT Daylighting Lab}, \emph{Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program \hfill Summer 2008}\\
Coded a daylighting simulation plugin, as part of a team, for SketchUp using Ruby and Java. Unified code and results from multiple master's theses. The plugin, `LightSolve', calculates natural lighting characteristics and interactively assists with design optimization.

%{\bf Luftsportverein Goch Flying Club}, \emph{Flight student \hfill 2005-2007}\\
%Sailplane instruction paid for by regular work at the aerodrome. Disassembled and repaired sailplanes, tended the bar, towed sailplanes and cables, mowed the runway, etc. Over 50 unpowered flying hours; longest solo flight of 5 hours; completed 2/3 of a glider pilot license with all interaction in German.
