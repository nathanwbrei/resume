	\section{EDUCATION}% 
		\textbf{Technical University of Munich} \\
		M.Sc. (Hons) Computational Science and Engineering (GPA: 3.5/4) \hfill Oct 2015 - May 2018
		
		\underline{Thesis:} Generating Small Sparse Matrix Multiplication Kernels for Knights Landing \\
			Generated optimally vectorized multiplication routines for small sparse matrices. Obtained a speedup of 1.8 for certain kernels of the SeisSol seismic simulator when running on Xeon Phi. Created a Python domain-specific language which generates raw AVX-512 instructions, building off of LibXSMM. 


		\underline{Honors Project:} Data-Intensive Distributed Computing Workflows in Light Microscopy \\
			Scaled Zeiss Microscopy's `Zen' image processing suite for high-throughput scenarios. Leveraged Apache Storm for automatic cloud deployment, scaling, and fault-tolerance. Frontend was an IronPython API; backend mixed C\# and Java. Served as technical lead on a team of 7. 

		\underline{Teaching Assistant:} Scientific Computing I, Winter Semester 2017

%		\underline{Coursework:} Numerical Programming, Parallel Programming, Computer Architecture, Algorithms. CFD Lab, Design Optimization, Variational Methods in Computer Vision. MPI, OpenMP, C/C++.


		\textbf{Massachusetts Institute of Technology} \\
		B.Sc. Aerospace Engineering (GPA: 3.6/5)\hfill Aug 2007 - June 2011

		\underline{Capstone project:} MIT Laboratory for Information Decision Systems \hfill 2011 \\
		Inferring information about the surroundings from ultrawideband radio waveforms. Multiclass classification of barriers blocking the line-of-sight, using support vector machines and MATLAB.

		\underline{Undergraduate research:} MIT Tech. Lab. for Advanced Materials and Structures \hfill Summer 2010 \\
		Grew aligned carbon nanotube forests on carbon fibers. Designed and built a device to hold individual carbon fibers under tension inside a CVD furnace.

		\underline{Undergraduate research:} MIT Daylighting Lab. \hfill Summer 2008 \\
		Used genetic algorithms for shape optimization to improve a building's daylighting performance. Integrated existing numerical codes and wrote tools for cleaning/annotating geometry. Frontend was a SketchUp CAD plugin in Ruby; backend was C. Worked on a team of 5 people. 


	\section{EXPERIENCE}

		{\bf Droit Financial Technologies}, Software Developer \hfill Sept 2013 - Sept 2015
		
		8th employee, 5th engineer. Contributed to ADEPT, a system for determining regulatory compliance obligations on derivatives trades. Knowledge engineering to model regulations which vary over time and interact in unstructured ways. Designed versioning systems to distinguish logic changes driven by regulators, driven by clients, or driven internally. Used Drools, Java, and Groovy.

		Designed and built a system for visually auditing decisions. All inputs, outputs, and version information are persisted to a MySQL or Oracle database. The system traces its execution path by annotating flowcharts and decision tables.

		Designed and built an AngularJS app for graphical rule editing, version management, and visualization/auditing, which replaced Drools Guvnor. The backend used Java, Spring, Hibernate.
	

		{\bf Makani Power}, Design Engineer Intern \hfill Nov 2013 - Feb 2014

		Contributed to Makani's Wing 7 integrated ground station, a truck-based platform acting as a winch, battery array, and perch for a UAV. Designed and fabricated structural elements and chain drives using steel, plastic, and carbon fiber. Used Siemens NX CAD and CosmosWorks FEA.

		 {\bf Daedalus Innovation}, Backend Web Developer \hfill 2012

		 Web application development using Python/Django/Postgres/Heroku.
