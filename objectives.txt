 I enjoy solving inverse and wicked problems using computers. I have just finished a Master's program specializing in writing low-level numerical code for highly parallel architectures. I would like to apply these skills to engineering or national security domains. I am particularly interested in opportunities involving scientific simulations, knowledge representation, computer vision, and CAD.




As a scientific software developer, I enjoy solving inverse, wicked, and otherwise computationally expensive problems. I have just finished a Master's program where I wrote low-level numerical code for highly parallel computer architectures to model geophysical problems. I would also enjoy architecting high-level, pattern-based, maintainable software systems (I have worked as an early employee at a successful fintech startup), or systems involving both hardware and software (I have a Bachelor's in aerospace engineering). I would like to apply my skills to engineering or national security domains. I am particularly interested in opportunities where I get to learn more about scientific simulations, knowledge representation, computer vision, and CAD. I'm looking for an environment where the mission comes foremost, the team works together closely, and I can proactively contribute to .

I'm looking for an environment where the mission comes foremost, the team works together closely, and (ideally) I could contribute proactively on several levels, including product requirements and design.


Objective

I am looking for software development roles in scientific, aerospace, or national security domains. I would prefer to write lower-level parallel/numerical C++, though I also enjoy designing higher-level maintainable software systems (e.g. in Java or Haskell) or writing code for specialized hardware (e.g. AVX-512). I am particularly interested in opportunities to expand my skills in scientific simulations, knowledge representation, computer vision, and CAD.
