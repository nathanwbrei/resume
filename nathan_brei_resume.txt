OBJECTIVE
---------

I am looking for software development roles in scientific, aerospace, or national security domains. I prefer writing lower-level parallel/numerical C++, though I also enjoy designing software systems at a higher level (e.g. in Java or Haskell) and writing code for specialized hardware (e.g. AVX-512). I am particularly interested in expanding my skills in scientific simulations, knowledge representation, computer vision, and CAD.

EXPERIENCE
----------

Droit Financial Technologies, Software Developer, Sept 2013 - Sept 2015
		
	8th employee, 5th engineer. Contributed to ADEPT, a system for determining regulatory compliance obligations on derivatives trades. Knowledge engineering to model regulations which vary over time and interact in unstructured ways. Designed versioning systems to distinguish logic changes driven by regulators, driven by clients, or driven internally. Used Drools, Java, and Groovy.

	Designed and built a system for visually auditing decisions. All inputs, outputs, and version information are persisted to a MySQL or Oracle database. The system traces its execution path by annotating flowcharts and decision tables.

	Designed and built an AngularJS app for graphical rule editing, version management, visualization, and auditing, to replace Drools Guvnor. The backend used Java, Spring, Hibernate.
	
	Managed complexity:	Set up Droit's first Jenkins continuous integration server. Merged entire codebase into a monorepo. Participated in technical discussions with potential clients at major financial institutions.
	

Makani Power
	Design Engineer Intern
	Nov 2012 - Feb 2013

	Contributed to Makani's Wing 7 integrated ground station, a truck-based platform acting as a winch, battery array, and perch for a UAV. Designed and fabricated structural elements and chain drives using steel, plastic, and carbon fiber. Used Siemens NX CAD and CosmosWorks FEA.


Daedalus Innovation
	Backend Web Developer
	2012

	Software engineering contracting work on the rapid development of a startup minimum-viable product, a website for arranging video chats between authors and book groups. The stack was Python, Django, Postgres, and Heroku. Coded core site functionality, integrated with external services such as OpenTok, and managed the deployment. 


MIT Tech. Lab. for Advanced Materials and Structures
	Undergraduate researcher
	Summer 2010

	Grew aligned carbon nanotube forests on carbon fibers. Designed and built a device to hold individual carbon fibers under tension inside a CVD furnace.


MIT Daylighting Lab
	Undergraduate researcher
	Summer 2008

	Contributed to a tool which used genetic algorithms for shape optimization to improve a building's daylighting performance. Integrated existing numerical codes and wrote tools for cleaning/annotating geometry. Frontend was a SketchUp CAD plugin in Ruby; backend was C. Worked on a team of 5 people.



EDUCATION
---------

Technical University of Munich
	M.Sc. (Hons) Computational Science and Engineering
	Oct 2015 - May 2018
		
	Thesis
		Title: Generating Small Sparse Matrix Multiplication Kernels for Knights Landing

		Supervisor: Carsten Uphoff & Michael Bader, TUM Chair of Scientific Computing

		Summary: Generated optimally vectorized multiplication routines for small sparse matrices. Obtained a speedup of 1.8 for certain kernels of the SeisSol seismic simulator when running on Xeon Phi. Created a Python domain-specific language which generates raw AVX-512 instructions, building off of LibXSMM. 


	Honors Project
		Title: Data-Intensive Distributed Computing Workflows in Light Microscopy 

		Supervisor: Daniel Butnaru, Zeiss Microscopy

		Summary: Scaled Zeiss Microscopy's `Zen' image processing suite for high-throughput scenarios. Leveraged Apache Storm for automatic cloud deployment, scaling, and fault-tolerance. Frontend was an IronPython API; backend mixed C# and Java. Served as technical lead on a team of 7. 

	Teaching Assistant
		Scientific Computing I, Winter Semester 2017


	Coursework
		Numerical Programming, Parallel Programming, Computer Architecture, Algorithms, Parallel Numerics.
		CFD Lab, Design Optimization, Variational Methods in Computer Vision.



Massachusetts Institute of Technology
	B.Sc. Aerospace Engineering
	Aug 2007 - June 2011

	Capstone project
		Supervisor: Moe Win, MIT Laboratory for Information Decision Systems

		Summary: Inferring information about the surroundings from ultrawideband radio waveforms. Multiclass classification of barriers blocking the line-of-sight, using support vector machines and MATLAB.


 	Awards: Lufthansa Prize for Excellence in German Studies, 3rd place


Recurse Center
	Participant
 	Feb 2013 -  May 2013

	A intensive writer's workshop for programmers, formerly known as Hacker School. Worked on a domain-specific language for representing folded paper structures. Wrote a tool to generate a laser-cuttable CAD file from a given assembly description. Experimented with procedural generation, using L-systems to create complex geometries with self-similarity. Used Python, Django, NodeBox, and SketchUp. Started learning Julia, Clojure, and OCaml.
