Work Experience
---------------

Sept 2013 -- Present

	Software engineer, Droit Financial Technologies
	New York, NY, USA}

	Droit provides a system for determining regulatory compliance obligations for over-the-counter derivatives trades. Our system is running in production at two major financial institutions. Our stack is Java, Groovy, Spring, Hibernate, Drools, JBoss, MySql, AngularJS. My work involves core knowledge representation & management, rules engines, introspection, and visualization. 

	- 


Sept 2012 -- Nov 2012

	Software engineer, Daedalus Innovation
	Williamsburg, VA, USA

	Daedalus provides software engineering contracting for rapid development of startup minimum-viable products. My particular project was BookAndTalk, a site for arranging video chats between authors and book groups. Our stack was Python, Django, PostgreSQL, OpenTok, Heroku. My work involved coding basic site functionality, integrating with external libraries such as OpenTok, and managing the deployment. 


Research and Internships
------------------------

Oct 2012 -- Feb 2013

	Mechanical engineering intern, Makani Power
	Alameda, CA, USA


	Makani Power (now "Google Makani") is developing a kite-like airborne wind turbine. I contributed to the design and implementation of the Wing 7 ground station, a truck-mounted anchor, winch, perch, and power station. My work focused on the mechanical design of structural elements and chain drives. Rapid iteration meant designing parts in CAD, performing finite element analysis, and building prototypes in the machine shop.


June 2012 -- Sept 2012

	Archaeology intern, Fairfield Foundation
	Gloucester, VA, USA

	Archaeological fieldwork at four colonial sites in Tidewater Virginia, involving surveying, digging, cleaning, interpreting, and mapping test units and shovel tests. Lab work involving sorting, cleaning, and cataloguing artifacts. I also did archival research on a historic estate, and helped renovate a 1920's gas station.


Fall 2010 -- Spring 2011

	Senior capstone project, MIT Laboratory of Information Decision Systems
	Cambridge, MA, USA

	Designed and executed a year-long experiment, with Robert Han, under the guidance of Prof Moe Win. Applied machine learning techniques to ultrawideband radio waveforms to improve localization performance. Tested ability to identify the material of barriers possibly blocking the line of sight. 


June 2010 -- Sept 2010

	Undergraduate research, MIT Technology Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Structures
	Cambridge, MA, USA

	Designed, machined, and tested a device to hold individual carbon fibers under tension inside a CVD furnace. Grew aligned carbon nanotube forests. Prepared carbon fibers with various coatings and tested their tensile strength. Prepared and cured graphite-epoxy composites.


June 2008 -- Sept 2008

	Undergraduate research, MIT Daylighting Lab
	Cambridge, MA, USA

	Coded a daylighting simulation plugin, as part of a team of 5 people, for SketchUp using Ruby and Java. Integrated code and equations from multiple master's theses. The plugin, `LightSolve', calculated natural lighting characteristics and interactively assists with design optimization.
